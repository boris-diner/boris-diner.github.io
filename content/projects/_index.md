## Hello from Projects!

This is a **test**. 

This is a curated list of projects from my ongoing research on fast direct solvers, computational electromagnetics, and numerical methods. I also plan to include selected past work in signal processing, image processing, and applications of information theory.

*More projects will be added soon.*
