## Topic of interest

My research focuses on fast direct solvers for computational electromagnetics, particularly for wave scattering problems involving dielectric and composite materials. I develop efficient algorithms that exploit the structure of integral equation formulations to reduce computational cost and enable scalable simulations of large and complex electromagnetic systems.
