  abstract  = {This thesis explores the development of fast direct solvers for electromagnetic scattering problems, with a focus on dielectric and composite materials. By leveraging the structure of boundary integral equations, the work introduces compression and factorization techniques that significantly reduce computational cost. The methods enable scalable and accurate simulations for complex electromagnetic environments..}
